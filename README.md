# RISC-V-Processor
Making my own RISC-V 32 bit Processor

This is starting as a project for EC 601 Product Design at Boston University.
I hope to continue to build on it after the conclusion of the class.
The current files support the RV32I instructions.
Next steps are to either add support for more instructions or to pipeline the datapath
